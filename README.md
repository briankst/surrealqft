# Surreal Quantum Field Theory

A theoretical framework unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity using surreal numbers, offering a deterministic interpretation of quantum phenomena while preserving measurement independence.

## Overview

This repository contains LaTeX documents describing Surreal Quantum Field Theory (SQFT), a novel approach that:

- Replaces quantum randomness with deterministic surreal tags
- Resolves Bell inequalities locally through superdeterminism
- Unifies quantum mechanics with gravity
- Makes testable predictions for future experiments

## Key Features

- Deterministic framework using surreal numbers (ℝ)
- Local resolution of Bell inequalities
- Integration with general relativity
- Preservation of Born statistics
- Testable predictions for CMB and other experiments

## Documents

- `surreal_paper.tex` - Main paper describing the complete theory
- `surreal.tex` - Detailed exploration of quantum mechanical aspects

## Predictions

The theory makes several testable predictions:

- CMB power spectrum modifications (~10⁻¹⁰)
- High-precision spectroscopy effects (δE/E ~ 10⁻¹⁷)
- Quantum optical phase shifts (δφ ~ 10⁻¹⁰)
- Gravitational wave mode shifts (δω/ω ~ 10⁻¹⁰)
