Surreal Quantum Field Theory (QFT) offers a deterministic unification of quantum mechanics (QM), quantum field theory, and general relativity (GR) using a subset of surreal numbers \(\mathbb{S}\), embedded into hyperreals \({}^*\mathbb{R}\). Infinitesimal ``tags'' (\(\epsilon_i\)) pre-set outcomes, providing a deterministic framework akin to classical mechanics while preserving measurement independence through statistical decoupling from experimental choices. The theory recovers Born statistics, resolves Bell inequalities locally, respects gauge and gravitational symmetries, and predicts subtle, falsifiable effects in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), atomic spectroscopy, quantum optics, and gravitational waves, testable with next-generation experiments.
